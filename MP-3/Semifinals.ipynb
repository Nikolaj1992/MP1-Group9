    "Intercept: -536.99\n",
    " The intercept is the predicted semifinal place when all features are 0, which doesn't have much practical interpretation in this case. But in case it was - a negative value that big is reason for concern that the values aren't coherent with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    " Coefficients:\n",
    "1. 'Year' (0.2738):\n",
    "       A one-year increase is associated with a slight increase (0.27) in the predicted semifinal place. \n",
    "        This suggests that over the years, the rankings have slightly moved upwards on average - aka they have gotten worse.\n",
    "2. 'Semi Final' (0.1695): \n",
    "    Moving from one semifinal to another is associated with a small increase (0.17) in the predicted place (so semi 2 is worse than semi 1), \n",
    "    reflecting possible differences in competition between the two semifinals. Perhaps because when the number of semifinalists are odd, one of the semifinals will have one more entry than the other - making it less likely to qualify from that semifinal.\n",
    "3. 'Semi Draw Position' (-0.0332): \n",
    "    A later performance position (higher number) is associated with a slight improvement (lower `semi_place`) in ranking. \n",
    "    This supports the idea that later performances might be more memorable or have an advantage, potentially due to recency bias.\n",
    "4. 'Semi Televote Points' (-0.0048): \n",
    "    As televote points increase, the predicted semifinal place improves (i.e., a better placement). \n",
    "    This is intuitive since more televote points would likely lead to a better semifinal result.\n",
    "5. 'Semi Jury Points' (0.0093): \n",
    "    A higher number of jury points is associated with a worse semifinal place (higher `semi_place`), which is unexpected and suggests that higher jury points alone don't necessarily guarantee a better place in the semifinal. Perhaps the televote disagrees more strongly with jury favorites than juries do with televote favorites, leading to jury favorites performing slightly worse overall in the total result? As we also have to keep in mind the total result have in most of these recorded years (2009-2023) been 50%/50% jury/televote based - with the exception of 2023 and up - where the juries were removed from semifinals entirely, but still remaining at the same capacity in the final.\n",
    "6. 'Semi Total Points' (-0.0597): \n",
    "    An increase in total points (combination of jury and televote) is associated with a better semifinal position \n",
    "    (lower `semi_place`), which is consistent with the idea that more points lead to a higher placement.\n",
    "\n",
    "A negative coefficient generally represents a negative correlation with semi_place - which actually is good - because that means the value in question \"negatively\" impacts the place result (the number becomes lower) - as the lower the place number is - the better it is - as 1 is the best result here. So fx a high number of point should give you a low place number - like 3rd place, and vice versa a low number of points would give you a \"high\" placing like 15th - which would make it less likely to qualify.\n"

    "#### Since Eurovision results have a tendency to be quite unpredictable, we don't expect these predictions to be entirely accurate. But an variance score of 68% is pretty alright for a song contest with a small number of possible positions - in theory up until 26 - but ususally less than 20. That means of course that there is 32% of the result variance in the semifinals we don't account for. This can generally just stem from the upredictability of Eurovision results - like country-specific tendencies (diaspora voting, political voting, bloc-voting etc.), or just disrepancies between the juries and televotes."
